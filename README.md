Cephtactics Dental Diagnosis Program


The Cephtactics Dental Diagnosis Program is a platform which has been designed to provide the users insight into various dental symptoms and easy understanding of the methods which would be employed for treatment one their visit to the dentist. It gives them a quick and easy pathway as to understanding the condition they present with better so as to be able to prioritize treatment with respect to urgency.

This would be the first stage of an automated symptom checker which would be able to help the patients in finding the fastest and closest clinicians available. The further projects that this would be directed to would be sorting clinicians based on area as well as cost and accesibility.

The aims of this project are to ensure that we provide the public with enhanced diagnositic criteria for common oral health ailments.


UX:
=======

The patient would be able to access clearly from the home page the condition that they have. They should expect to know what they have and the urgency of their pathology.

User 1 - I could navigate the website easily and ended up with easily accesible data, the contact page was large and available.

User 2 - Finding out the problem with my condition was easy, contacting the team was simple, deciding on the location would be the next step.


Wireframes:
=======

Wireframes used were handwritten, I have not used Balsamiq. I have 6 pages of wireframe markups present.

Features:
=======

Existing Features - 

- Ability to review a simple list of symptoms in 3 different pages.

- The ability to upload a picture of their symptoms is possible at the last form.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement - 

- More complex symptom checker, where location and time of the problem has been considered.

- Location platform of dentists available with regards to time, cost, location and urgency for the condition which is present.

- Emergency dentist availablilty and location.

Technologies Used - 

I used HTML, CSS as well as Bootstrap to develop the site.

Testing:
=======

I performed the first test to check the ability of the user to understand the main conditions present on mobile as well as desktop devices. 
The second tests incorporated used to check the accesibility from one page to another, ability to fill in the end form on both mobile and desktop devices.
Final testing was done where I tested the end result with respect to the multiple users and took their considerations into account regarding the user interface.

I have not run any automated tests.

The first testing outcomes:
Problems with padding in the menu on mobiles

Contact form:
=======

When we submit the empty form we can verify that an error message about the required fields appears.

When we submit the form with an invalid email address we can verify that a relevant error message appears.

When we submit the form with all inputs validwe can verify that a success message appears - success message appears.

Bugs and errors:
=======

Early bugs included the menu padding during the mobile view.

The biggest bugs we found were with the padding in the initial stages when viewing the site on mobile devices.

The bugs with respect to items which have not been corrected include the blue sweep which comes on the main menu as well as the size of the logo on a mobile device.

Deployment:
=======

We have deployed the site on Github under the following: https://github.com/Rajjabbal/milestone-project

There are no changes to the deployed and development versions of the sites.
